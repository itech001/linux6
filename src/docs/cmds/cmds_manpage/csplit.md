###description
```
       Output pieces of FILE separated by PATTERN(s) to files 'xx00', 'xx01', ..., and output byte counts of each piece to standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --suffix-format=FORMAT
              use sprintf FORMAT instead of %02d

       -f, --prefix=PREFIX
              use PREFIX instead of 'xx'

       -k, --keep-files
              do not remove output files on errors

       -n, --digits=DIGITS
              use specified number of digits instead of 2

       -s, --quiet, --silent
              do not print counts of output file sizes

       -z, --elide-empty-files
              remove empty output files

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Read standard input if FILE is -.  Each PATTERN may be:

       INTEGER
              copy up to but not including specified line number

       /REGEXP/[OFFSET]
              copy up to but not including a matching line

       %REGEXP%[OFFSET]
              skip to, but not including a matching line

       {INTEGER}
              repeat the previous pattern specified number of times

       {*}    repeat the previous pattern as many times as possible

       A line OFFSET is a required '+' or '-' followed by a positive integer.
