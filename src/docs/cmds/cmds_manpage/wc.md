```
       Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if more than one FILE is specified.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.  A word is a non-zero-length sequence of characters delimited by white space.  The options below may be used to select which counts are printed, always in the following order: newline, word, character, byte, maximum line length.

       -c, --bytes
              print the byte counts

       -m, --chars
              print the character counts

       -l, --lines
              print the newline counts

       --files0-from=F
              read input from the files specified by NUL-terminated names in file F; If F is - then read names from standard input

       -L, --max-line-length
              print the length of the longest line

       -w, --words
              print the word counts

       --help display this help and exit
