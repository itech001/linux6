#cat is used to read text files. 
cat file.txt

# cat concatenates a list of files
cat file1 file2

# abusing cat to read a single file is considered bad practice
cat onefile | foo # DON'T DO THIS
# instead use the following
< onefile foo

# random hex-calculation to let your terminal look busy
cat /dev/urandom | hexdump -C | grep "ca fe"

# Show tabs in a file
cat -T file.txt
