<h3 id="description">description</h3>
<pre><code>       bzip2  compresses  files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm,
       and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more
       conventional  LZ77/LZ78-based  compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family
       of statistical compressors.

       The command-line options are deliberately very similar to those of GNU gzip,  but  they  are
       not identical.

       bzip2  expects  a  list  of  file  names  to accompany the command-line flags.  Each file is
       replaced by a compressed version of itself, with the name  &quot;original_name.bz2&quot;.   Each  com‐
       pressed  file  has the same modification date, permissions, and, when possible, ownership as
       the corresponding original, so that these properties can be correctly restored at decompres‐
       sion time.  File name handling is naive in the sense that there is no mechanism for preserv‐
       ing original file names, permissions, ownerships or dates in filesystems  which  lack  these
       concepts, or have serious file name length restrictions, such as MS-DOS.

       bzip2 and bunzip2 will by default not overwrite existing files.  If you want this to happen,
       specify the -f flag.

       If no file names are specified, bzip2 compresses from standard input to standard output.  In
       this  case,  bzip2  will  decline to write compressed output to a terminal, as this would be
       entirely incomprehensible and therefore pointless.

       bunzip2 (or bzip2 -d) decompresses all specified files.  Files which  were  not  created  by
       bzip2 will be detected and ignored, and a warning issued.  bzip2 attempts to guess the file‐
       name for the decompressed file from that of the compressed file as follows:

              filename.bz2    becomes   filename
              filename.bz     becomes   filename
              filename.tbz2   becomes   filename.tar
              filename.tbz    becomes   filename.tar
              anyothername    becomes   anyothername.out

       If the file does not end in one of the recognised endings, .bz2, .bz, .tbz2 or  .tbz,  bzip2
       complains  that  it  cannot  guess the name of the original file, and uses the original name
       with .out appended.

       As with compression, supplying no filenames causes  decompression  from  standard  input  to
       standard output.

       bunzip2  will  correctly  decompress  a  file which is the concatenation of two or more com‐
       pressed files.  The result is the concatenation of  the  corresponding  uncompressed  files.
       Integrity testing (-t) of concatenated compressed files is also supported.

       You  can  also  compress  or  decompress files to the standard output by giving the -c flag.
       Multiple files may be compressed and decompressed like this.  The resulting outputs are  fed
       sequentially  to  stdout.   Compression  of multiple files in this manner generates a stream
       containing multiple compressed file representations.  Such a stream can be decompressed cor‐
       rectly  only  by  bzip2  version  0.9.0 or later.  Earlier versions of bzip2 will stop after
       decompressing the first file in the stream.

       bzcat (or bzip2 -dc) decompresses all specified files to the standard output.

       bzip2 will read arguments from the environment variables BZIP2 and BZIP, in that order,  and
       will  process them before any arguments read from the command line.  This gives a convenient
       way to supply default arguments.

       Compression is always performed, even if the compressed file is  slightly  larger  than  the
       original.  Files of less than about one hundred bytes tend to get larger, since the compres‐
       sion mechanism has a constant overhead in the region of 50 bytes.   Random  data  (including
       the  output of most file compressors) is coded at about 8.05 bits per byte, giving an expan‐
       sion of around 0.5%.

       As a self-check for your protection, bzip2 uses 32-bit CRCs to make  sure  that  the  decom‐
       pressed  version  of a file is identical to the original.  This guards against corruption of
       the compressed data, and against undetected bugs in bzip2 (hopefully  very  unlikely).   The
       chances of data corruption going undetected is microscopic, about one chance in four billion
       for each file processed.  Be aware, though, that the check occurs upon decompression, so  it
       can  only  tell  you that something is wrong.  It can't help you recover the original uncom‐
       pressed data.  You can use bzip2recover to try to recover data from damaged files.

       Return values: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file  not  found,  invalid
       flags,  I/O  errors, &amp;c), 2 to indicate a corrupt compressed file, 3 for an internal consis‐
       tency error (eg, bug) which caused bzip2 to panic.

<h3 id="options">options</h3>
<pre><code>       -c --stdout
              Compress or decompress to standard output.

       -d --decompress
              Force decompression.  bzip2, bunzip2 and bzcat are really the same program,  and  the
              decision about what actions to take is done on the basis of which name is used.  This
              flag overrides that mechanism, and forces bzip2 to decompress.

       -z --compress
              The complement to -d: forces compression, regardless of the invocation name.

       -t --test
              Check integrity of the specified file(s), but don't  decompress  them.   This  really
              performs a trial decompression and throws away the result.

       -f --force
              Force  overwrite of output files.  Normally, bzip2 will not overwrite existing output
              files.  Also forces bzip2 to break hard links to files, which it  otherwise  wouldn't
              do.

              bzip2 normally declines to decompress files which don't have the correct magic header
              bytes.  If forced (-f), however, it will pass such files through unmodified.  This is
              how GNU gzip behaves.

       -k --keep
              Keep (don't delete) input files during compression or decompression.

       -s --small
              Reduce  memory  usage,  for compression, decompression and testing.  Files are decom‐
              pressed and tested using a modified algorithm which only requires 2.5 bytes per block
              byte.   This  means any file can be decompressed in 2300 k of memory, albeit at about
              half the normal speed.

              During compression, -s selects a block size of 200 k,  which  limits  memory  use  to
              around  the same figure, at the expense of your compression ratio.  In short, if your
              machine is low on memory (8 megabytes or less), use -s for  everything.   See  MEMORY
              MANAGEMENT below.

       -q --quiet
              Suppress non-essential warning messages.  Messages pertaining to I/O errors and other
              critical events will not be suppressed.

       -v --verbose
              Verbose mode -- show the compression ratio for each  file  processed.   Further  -v's
              increase  the  verbosity level, spewing out lots of information which is primarily of
              interest for diagnostic purposes.

       -h --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -L --license -V --version
              Display the software version, license terms and conditions.

       -1 (or --fast) to -9 (or --best)
              Set the block size to 100 k, 200 k ...  900 k when compressing.  Has no  effect  when
              decompressing.   See MEMORY MANAGEMENT below.  The --fast and --best aliases are pri‐
              marily for GNU gzip compatibility.  In particular, --fast doesn't make things signif‐
              icantly faster.  And --best merely selects the default behaviour.

       --     Treats  all subsequent arguments as file names, even if they start with a dash.  This
              is so you can handle files with names beginning with a dash, for  example:  bzip2  --
              -myfilename.

       --repetitive-fast --repetitive-best
              These  flags  are  redundant  in versions 0.9.5 and above.  They provided some coarse
              control over the behaviour of the sorting algorithm in earlier  versions,  which  was
              sometimes  useful.   0.9.5  and  above have an improved algorithm which renders these
              flags irrelevant.

<h3 id="memory-management">memory management</h3>
<pre><code>       bzip2 compresses large files in blocks.  The block size affects both the  compression  ratio
       achieved,  and  the amount of memory needed for compression and decompression.  The flags -1
       through -9 specify the block size to be 100,000 bytes through 900,000  bytes  (the  default)
       respectively.   At  decompression time, the block size used for compression is read from the
       header of the compressed file, and bunzip2 then  allocates  itself  just  enough  memory  to
       decompress  the file.  Since block sizes are stored in compressed files, it follows that the
       flags -1 to -9 are irrelevant to and so ignored during decompression.

       Compression and decompression requirements, in bytes, can be estimated as:

              Compression:   400 k + ( 8 x block size )

              Decompression: 100 k + ( 4 x block size ), or
                             100 k + ( 2.5 x block size )

       Larger block sizes give rapidly diminishing marginal returns.  Most of the compression comes
       from the first two or three hundred k of block size, a fact worth bearing in mind when using
       bzip2 on small machines.  It is also important to appreciate that the  decompression  memory
       requirement is set at compression time by the choice of block size.

       For  files  compressed  with  the  default 900 k block size, bunzip2 will require about 3700
       kbytes to decompress.  To support decompression of any file on a 4 megabyte machine, bunzip2
       has  an  option  to  decompress  using  approximately half this amount of memory, about 2300
       kbytes.  Decompression speed is also halved, so you should use this option only where neces‐
       sary.  The relevant flag is -s.

       In  general,  try  and  use the largest block size memory constraints allow, since that max‐
       imises the compression achieved.  Compression and decompression speed  are  virtually  unaf‐
       fected by block size.

       Another  significant  point  applies to files which fit in a single block -- that means most
       files you'd encounter using a large block size.  The amount of real memory touched  is  pro‐
       portional  to  the  size  of the file, since the file is smaller than a block.  For example,
       compressing a file 20,000 bytes long with the flag -9 will cause the compressor to  allocate
       around  7600 k  of  memory, but only touch 400 k + 20000 * 8 = 560 kbytes of it.  Similarly,
       the decompressor will allocate 3700 k but only touch 100 k + 20000 * 4 = 180 kbytes.

       Here is a table which summarises the maximum memory usage for different block  sizes.   Also
       recorded  is  the  total compressed size for 14 files of the Calgary Text Compression Corpus
       totalling 3,141,622 bytes.  This column gives some feel  for  how  compression  varies  with
       block size.  These figures tend to understate the advantage of larger block sizes for larger
       files, since the Corpus is dominated by smaller files.

<h3 id="recovering-data-from-damaged-files">recovering data from damaged files</h3>
<pre><code>       bzip2 compresses files in blocks, usually 900 kbytes long.  Each block is  handled  indepen‐
       dently.   If a media or transmission error causes a multi-block .bz2 file to become damaged,
       it may be possible to recover data from the undamaged blocks in the file.

       The compressed representation of each block is delimited by a 48-bit pattern, which makes it
       possible  to  find  the block boundaries with reasonable certainty.  Each block also carries
       its own 32-bit CRC, so damaged blocks can be distinguished from undamaged ones.

       bzip2recover is a simple program whose purpose is to search for blocks in  .bz2  files,  and
       write  each  block  out  into  its  own  .bz2  file.   You can then use bzip2 -t to test the
       integrity of the resulting files, and decompress those which are undamaged.

       bzip2recover takes a single argument, the name of the damaged file, and writes a  number  of
       files  &quot;rec00001file.bz2&quot;, &quot;rec00002file.bz2&quot;, etc., containing the  extracted  blocks.  The
       output filenames are designed so that the use of wildcards in subsequent processing  --  for
       example,  &quot;bzip2  -dc  rec*file.bz2  &gt; recovered_data&quot; -- processes the files in the correct
       order.

       bzip2recover should be of most use dealing with large .bz2 files, as these will contain many
       blocks.  It is clearly futile to use it on damaged single-block files, since a damaged block
       cannot be recovered.  If you wish to minimise any  potential  data  loss  through  media  or
       transmission errors, you might consider compressing with a smaller block size.


</code></pre>

<h3 id="performance-notes">performance notes</h3>
<pre><code>       The  sorting  phase of compression gathers together similar strings in the file.  Because of
       this, files containing very long runs of repeated symbols, like &quot;aabaabaabaab ...&quot; (repeated
       several  hundred times) may compress more slowly than normal.  Versions 0.9.5 and above fare
       much better than previous versions in this respect.  The ratio between worst-case and  aver‐
       age-case  compression time is in the region of 10:1.  For previous versions, this figure was
       more like 100:1.  You can use the -vvvv option to monitor progress in great detail,  if  you
       want.

       Decompression speed is unaffected by these phenomena.

       bzip2 usually allocates several megabytes of memory to operate in, and then charges all over
       it in a fairly random fashion.  This means that performance, both for compressing and decom‐
       pressing, is largely determined by the speed at which your machine can service cache misses.
       Because of this, small changes to the code to reduce the miss rate  have  been  observed  to
       give  disproportionately  large performance improvements.  I imagine bzip2 will perform best
       on machines with very large caches.


</code></pre>

<h3 id="caveats">caveats</h3>
<pre><code>       I/O error messages are not as helpful as they could be.  bzip2  tries  hard  to  detect  I/O
       errors  and  exit cleanly, but the details of what the problem is sometimes seem rather mis‐
       leading.

       This manual page pertains to version 1.0.6 of bzip2.  Compressed data created by  this  ver‐
       sion  is  entirely forwards and backwards compatible with the previous public releases, ver‐
       sions 0.1pl2, 0.9.0, 0.9.5, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 and above, but with the following exception:
       0.9.0  and  above  can  correctly decompress multiple concatenated compressed files.  0.1pl2
       cannot do this; it will stop after decompressing just the first file in the stream.

       bzip2recover versions prior to 1.0.2 used 32-bit integers to represent bit positions in com‐
       pressed files, so they could not handle compressed files more than 512 megabytes long.  Ver‐
       sions 1.0.2 and above use 64-bit ints on some platforms which support  them  (GNU  supported
       targets, and Windows).  To establish whether or not bzip2recover was built with such a limi‐
       tation, run it without arguments.  In any event you can build yourself an unlimited  version
       if you can recompile it with MaybeUInt64 set to be an unsigned 64-bit integer.

       encouraged  me  to  look for faster sorting algorithms, so as to speed up compression.  Bela
       Lubkin encouraged me to improve the  worst-case  compression  performance.   Donna  Robinson
       XMLised the documentation.  The bz* scripts are derived from those of GNU gzip.  Many people
       sent patches, helped with portability problems, lent machines, gave advice and  were  gener‐
       ally helpful.
