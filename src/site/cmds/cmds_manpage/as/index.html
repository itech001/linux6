<h3 id="description">description</h3>
<pre><code>       GNU as is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax.

       as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C compiler &quot;gcc&quot; for use by the linker &quot;ld&quot;.  Nevertheless, we've tried to make as assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same machine would assemble.  Any exceptions are documented explicitly.  This doesn't mean as always uses the same syntax as another assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.

       Each time you run as it assembles exactly one source program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.  (The standard input is also a file.)

       You give as a command line that has zero or more input file names.  The input files are read (from left file name to right).  A command line argument (in any position) that has no special meaning is taken to be an input file name.

       If you give as no file names it attempts to read one input file from the as standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You may have to type ctl-D to tell as there is no more program to assemble.

       Use -- if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in your command line.

       If the source is empty, as produces a small, empty object file.

       as may write warnings and error messages to the standard error file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a compiler runs as automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so that as could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave problem that stops the assembly.

       If you are invoking as via the GNU C compiler, you can use the -Wa option to pass arguments through to the assembler.  The assembler arguments must be separated from each other (and the -Wa) by commas.  For example:

               gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c

       This passes two options to the assembler: -alh (emit a listing to standard output with high-level and assembly source) and -L (retain local symbols in the symbol table).

       Usually you do not need to use this -Wa mechanism, since many compiler command-line options are automatically passed to the assembler by the compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver with the -v option to see precisely what options it passes to each compilation pass, including the assembler.)

</code></pre>

<h3 id="options">options</h3>
<pre><code>       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.

       -a[cdghlmns]
           Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:

           -ac omit false conditionals

           -ad omit debugging directives

           -ag include general information, like as version and options passed

           -ah include high-level source

           -al include assembly

           -am include macro expansions

           -an omit forms processing

           -as include symbols

           =file
               set the name of the listing file

           You may combine these options; for example, use -aln for assembly listing without forms processing.  The =file option, if used, must be the last one.  By itself, -a defaults to -ahls.

       --alternate
           Begin in alternate macro mode.

       --compress-debug-sections
           Compress DWARF debug sections using zlib.  The debug sections are renamed to begin with .zdebug, and the resulting object file may not be compatible with older linkers and object file utilities.

       --nocompress-debug-sections
           Do not compress DWARF debug sections.  This is the default.

       -D  Ignored.  This option is accepted for script compatibility with calls to other assemblers.

       --debug-prefix-map old=new
           When assembling files in directory old, record debugging information describing them as in new instead.

       --defsym sym=value
           Define the symbol sym to be value before assembling the input file.  value must be an integer constant.  As in C, a leading 0x indicates a hexadecimal value, and a leading 0 indicates an octal value.  The value of the symbol can be overridden inside a source file via the use of a &quot;.set&quot; pseudo-op.

       -f  &quot;fast&quot;---skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is compiler output).

       -g
       --gen-debug
           Generate debugging information for each assembler source line using whichever debug format is preferred by the target.  This currently means either STABS, ECOFF or DWARF2.

       --gstabs
           Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line.  This may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle it.

       --gstabs+
           Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line, with GNU extensions that probably only gdb can handle, and that could make other debuggers crash or refuse to read your program.  This may help debugging assembler code.  Currently the only GNU extension is the location of the current working directory at assembling time.

       --gdwarf-2
           Generate DWARF2 debugging information for each assembler line.  This may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle it.  Note---this option is only supported by some targets, not all of them.

       --gdwarf-sections
           Instead of creating a .debug_line section, create a series of .debug_line.foo sections where foo is the name of the corresponding code section.  For example a code section called .text.func will have its dwarf line number information placed into a section called .debug_line.text.func.  If the code section is just called .text then debug line section will still be called just .debug_line without any suffix.

       --size-check=error
       --size-check=warning
           Issue an error or warning for invalid ELF .size directive.

       --help
           Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       --target-help
           Print a summary of all target specific options and exit.

       -I dir
           Add directory dir to the search list for &quot;.include&quot; directives.

       -J  Don't warn about signed overflow.

       -K  Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long displacements.

       -L
       --keep-locals
           Keep (in the symbol table) local symbols.  These symbols start with system-specific local label prefixes, typically .L for ELF systems or L for traditional a.out systems.

       --listing-lhs-width=number
           Set the maximum width, in words, of the output data column for an assembler listing to number.

       --listing-lhs-width2=number
           Set the maximum width, in words, of the output data column for continuation lines in an assembler listing to number.

       --listing-rhs-width=number
           Set the maximum width of an input source line, as displayed in a listing, to number bytes.

       --listing-cont-lines=number
           Set the maximum number of lines printed in a listing for a single line of input to number + 1.

       -o objfile
           Name the object-file output from as objfile.

       -R  Fold the data section into the text section.

           Set the default size of GAS's hash tables to a prime number close to number.  Increasing this value can reduce the length of time it takes the assembler to perform its tasks, at the expense of increasing the assembler's memory requirements.  Similarly reducing this value can reduce the memory requirements at the expense of speed.

       --reduce-memory-overheads
           This option reduces GAS's memory requirements, at the expense of making the assembly processes slower.  Currently this switch is a synonym for --hash-size=4051, but in the future it may have other effects as well.

       --statistics
           Print the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in seconds) used by assembly.

       --strip-local-absolute
           Remove local absolute symbols from the outgoing symbol table.

       -v
       -version
           Print the as version.

       --version
           Print the as version and exit.

       -W
       --no-warn
           Suppress warning messages.

       --fatal-warnings
           Treat warnings as errors.

       --warn
           Don't suppress warning messages or treat them as errors.

       -w  Ignored.

       -x  Ignored.

       -Z  Generate an object file even after errors.

       -- | files ...
           Standard input, or source files to assemble.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the 64-bit mode of the ARM Architecture (AArch64).

       -EB This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler should be marked as being encoded for a big-endian processor.

       -EL This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler should be marked as being encoded for a little-endian processor.

       -mabi=abi
           Specify which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized arguments are: &quot;ilp32&quot; and &quot;lp64&quot;, which decides the generated object file in ELF32 and ELF64 format respectively.  The default is &quot;lp64&quot;.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Alpha processor.

       -mcpu
           This option specifies the target processor.  If an attempt is made to assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target processor, the assembler may either expand the instruction as a macro or issue an error message.  This option is equivalent to the &quot;.arch&quot; directive.

           The following processor names are recognized: 21064, &quot;21064a&quot;, 21066, 21068, 21164, &quot;21164a&quot;, &quot;21164pc&quot;, 21264, &quot;21264a&quot;, &quot;21264b&quot;, &quot;ev4&quot;, &quot;ev5&quot;, &quot;lca45&quot;, &quot;ev5&quot;, &quot;ev56&quot;, &quot;pca56&quot;, &quot;ev6&quot;, &quot;ev67&quot;, &quot;ev68&quot;.  The special name &quot;all&quot; may be used to allow the assembler to accept instructions valid for any Alpha processor.

           In order to support existing practice in OSF/1 with respect to &quot;.arch&quot;, and existing practice within MILO (the Linux ARC bootloader), the numbered processor names (e.g. 21064) enable the processor-specific PALcode instructions, while the &quot;electro-vlasic&quot; names (e.g. &quot;ev4&quot;) do not.

       -mdebug
       -no-mdebug
           Enables or disables the generation of &quot;.mdebug&quot; encapsulation for stabs directives and procedure descriptors.  The default is to automatically enable &quot;.mdebug&quot; when the first stabs directive is seen.

       -relax
           This option forces all relocations to be put into the object file, instead of saving space and resolving some relocations at assembly time.  Note that this option does not propagate all symbol arithmetic into the object file, because not all symbol arithmetic can be represented.  However, the option can still be useful in specific applications.

       -replace
       -noreplace
           Enables or disables the optimization of procedure calls, both at assemblage and at link time.  These options are only available for VMS targets and &quot;-replace&quot; is the default.  See section 1.4.1 of the OpenVMS Linker Utility Manual.

       -g  This option is used when the compiler generates debug information.  When gcc is using mips-tfile to generate debug information for ECOFF, local labels must be passed through to the object file.  Otherwise this option has no effect.

       -Gsize
           A local common symbol larger than size is placed in &quot;.bss&quot;, while smaller symbols are placed in &quot;.sbss&quot;.

       -F
       -32addr
           These options are ignored for backward compatibility.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an ARC processor.

       -k  Specify that PIC code has been generated.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Blackfin processor family.

       -mcpu=processor[-sirevision]
           This option specifies the target processor.  The optional sirevision is not used in assembler.  It's here such that GCC can easily pass down its &quot;-mcpu=&quot; option.  The assembler will issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The following processor names are recognized: &quot;bf504&quot;, &quot;bf506&quot;, &quot;bf512&quot;, &quot;bf514&quot;, &quot;bf516&quot;, &quot;bf518&quot;, &quot;bf522&quot;, &quot;bf523&quot;, &quot;bf524&quot;, &quot;bf525&quot;, &quot;bf526&quot;, &quot;bf527&quot;, &quot;bf531&quot;, &quot;bf532&quot;, &quot;bf533&quot;, &quot;bf534&quot;, &quot;bf535&quot; (not implemented yet), &quot;bf536&quot;, &quot;bf537&quot;, &quot;bf538&quot;, &quot;bf539&quot;, &quot;bf542&quot;, &quot;bf542m&quot;, &quot;bf544&quot;, &quot;bf544m&quot;, &quot;bf547&quot;, &quot;bf547m&quot;, &quot;bf548&quot;, &quot;bf548m&quot;, &quot;bf549&quot;, &quot;bf549m&quot;, &quot;bf561&quot;, and &quot;bf592&quot;.

       -mepiphany
           Specifies that the both 32 and 16 bit instructions are allowed.  This is the default behavior.

       -mepiphany16
           Restricts the permitted instructions to just the 16 bit set.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an H8/300 processor.  @chapter H8/300 Dependent Features

   Options
       The Renesas H8/300 version of &quot;as&quot; has one machine-dependent option:

       -h-tick-hex
           Support H'00 style hex constants in addition to 0x00 style.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an i386 processor.

       --32 | --x32 | --64
           Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  --32 implies Intel i386 architecture, while --x32 and --64 imply AMD x86-64 architecture with 32-bit or 64-bit word-size respectively.

           These options are only available with the ELF object file format, and require that the necessary BFD support has been included (on a 32-bit platform you have to add --enable-64-bit-bfd to configure enable 64-bit usage and use x86-64 as target platform).

       -n  By default, x86 GAS replaces multiple nop instructions used for alignment within code sections with multi-byte nop instructions such as leal 0(%esi,1),%esi.  This switch disables the optimization.

       --divide
           On SVR4-derived platforms, the character / is treated as a comment character, which means that it cannot be used in expressions.  The --divide option turns / into a normal character.  This does not disable / at the beginning of a line starting a comment, or affect using # for starting a comment.

       -march=CPU[+EXTENSION...]
           This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The following processor names are recognized: &quot;i8086&quot;, &quot;i186&quot;, &quot;i286&quot;, &quot;i386&quot;, &quot;i486&quot;, &quot;i586&quot;, &quot;i686&quot;, &quot;pentium&quot;, &quot;pentiumpro&quot;, &quot;pentiumii&quot;, &quot;pentiumiii&quot;, &quot;pentium4&quot;, &quot;prescott&quot;, &quot;nocona&quot;, &quot;core&quot;, &quot;core2&quot;, &quot;corei7&quot;, &quot;l1om&quot;, &quot;k1om&quot;, &quot;k6&quot;, &quot;k6_2&quot;, &quot;athlon&quot;, &quot;opteron&quot;, &quot;k8&quot;, &quot;amdfam10&quot;, &quot;bdver1&quot;, &quot;bdver2&quot;, &quot;bdver3&quot;, &quot;btver1&quot;, &quot;btver2&quot;, &quot;generic32&quot; and &quot;generic64&quot;.

           In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told to accept various extension mnemonics.  For example, &quot;-march=i686+sse4+vmx&quot; extends i686 with sse4 and vmx.  The following extensions are currently supported: 8087, 287, 387, &quot;no87&quot;, &quot;mmx&quot;, &quot;nommx&quot;, &quot;sse&quot;, &quot;sse2&quot;, &quot;sse3&quot;, &quot;ssse3&quot;, &quot;sse4.1&quot;, &quot;sse4.2&quot;, &quot;sse4&quot;, &quot;nosse&quot;, &quot;avx&quot;, &quot;avx2&quot;, &quot;adx&quot;, &quot;rdseed&quot;, &quot;prfchw&quot;, &quot;smap&quot;, &quot;mpx&quot;, &quot;sha&quot;, &quot;avx512f&quot;, &quot;avx512cd&quot;, &quot;avx512er&quot;, &quot;avx512pf&quot;, &quot;noavx&quot;, &quot;vmx&quot;, &quot;vmfunc&quot;, &quot;smx&quot;, &quot;xsave&quot;, &quot;xsaveopt&quot;, &quot;aes&quot;, &quot;pclmul&quot;, &quot;fsgsbase&quot;, &quot;rdrnd&quot;, &quot;f16c&quot;, &quot;bmi2&quot;, &quot;fma&quot;, &quot;movbe&quot;, &quot;ept&quot;, &quot;lzcnt&quot;, &quot;hle&quot;, &quot;rtm&quot;, &quot;invpcid&quot;, &quot;clflush&quot;, &quot;lwp&quot;, &quot;fma4&quot;, &quot;xop&quot;, &quot;cx16&quot;, &quot;syscall&quot;, &quot;rdtscp&quot;, &quot;3dnow&quot;, &quot;3dnowa&quot;, &quot;sse4a&quot;, &quot;sse5&quot;, &quot;svme&quot;, &quot;abm&quot; and &quot;padlock&quot;.  Note that rather than extending a basic instruction set, the extension mnemonics starting with &quot;no&quot; revoke the respective functionality.

           When the &quot;.arch&quot; directive is used with -march, the &quot;.arch&quot; directive will take precedent.

       -mtune=CPU
           This option specifies a processor to optimize for. When used in conjunction with the -march option, only instructions of the processor specified by the -march option will be generated.

           Valid CPU values are identical to the processor list of -march=CPU.

       -msse2avx
           This option specifies that the assembler should encode SSE instructions with VEX prefix.

       -msse-check=none
       -msse-check=warning
       -msse-check=error
           These options control if the assembler should check SSE instructions.  -msse-check=none will make the assembler not to check SSE instructions,  which is the default.  -msse-check=warning will make the assembler issue a warning for any SSE instruction.  -msse-check=error will make the assembler issue an error for any SSE instruction.

       -mavxscalar=128
       -mavxscalar=256
           These options control how the assembler should encode scalar AVX instructions.  -mavxscalar=128 will encode scalar AVX instructions with 128bit vector length, which is the default.  -mavxscalar=256 will encode scalar AVX instructions with 256bit vector length.

       -mevexlig=128
       -mevexlig=256
       -mevexlig=512
           These options control how the assembler should encode length-ignored (LIG) EVEX instructions.  -mevexlig=128 will encode LIG EVEX instructions with 128bit vector length, which is the default.  -mevexlig=256 and -mevexlig=512 will encode LIG EVEX instructions with 256bit and 512bit vector length, respectively.

       -mevexwig=0
       -mevexwig=1
           These options control how the assembler should encode w-ignored (WIG) EVEX instructions.  -mevexwig=0 will encode WIG EVEX instructions with evex.w = 0, which is the default.  -mevexwig=1 will encode WIG EVEX instructions with evex.w = 1.

       -mmnemonic=att
       -mmnemonic=intel
           This option specifies instruction mnemonic for matching instructions.  The &quot;.att_mnemonic&quot; and &quot;.intel_mnemonic&quot; directives will take precedent.

       -msyntax=att
       -msyntax=intel
           This option specifies instruction syntax when processing instructions.  The &quot;.att_syntax&quot; and &quot;.intel_syntax&quot; directives will take precedent.

       -mnaked-reg
           This opetion specifies that registers don't require a % prefix.  The &quot;.att_syntax&quot; and &quot;.intel_syntax&quot; directives will take precedent.

       -madd-bnd-prefix
           This option forces the assembler to add BND prefix to all branches, even if such prefix was not explicitly specified in the source code.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Intel 80960 processor.

       -ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC

           Restores the default behaviour, which restricts the permitted instructions to just the basic IP2022 ones.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Renesas M32C and M16C processors.

       -m32c
           Assemble M32C instructions.

       --m32rx
           Specify which processor in the M32R family is the target.  The default is normally the M32R, but this option changes it to the M32RX.

       --warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts or --Wp
           Produce warning messages when questionable parallel constructs are encountered.

       --no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts or --Wnp
           Do not produce warning messages when questionable parallel constructs are encountered.

       The following options are available when as is configured for the Motorola 68000 series.

       -l  Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of two.

       -m68000 | -m68008 | -m68010 | -m68020 | -m68030
       | -m68040 | -m68060 | -m68302 | -m68331 | -m68332
       | -m68333 | -m68340 | -mcpu32 | -m5200
           Specify what processor in the 68000 family is the target.  The default is normally the 68020, but this can be changed at configuration time.

       -m68881 | -m68882 | -mno-68881 | -mno-68882
           The target machine does (or does not) have a floating-point coprocessor.  The default is to assume a coprocessor for 68020, 68030, and cpu32.  Although the basic 68000 is not compatible with the 68881, a combination of the two can be specified, since it's possible to do emulation of the coprocessor instructions with the main processor.

       -m68851 | -mno-68851
           The target machine does (or does not) have a memory-management unit coprocessor.  The default is to assume an MMU for 68020 and up.

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Altera Nios II processor.

       -relax-section
           Replace identified out-of-range branches with PC-relative &quot;jmp&quot; sequences when possible.  The generated code sequences are suitable for use in position-independent code, but there is a practical limit on the extended branch range because of the length of the sequences.  This option is the default.

       -relax-all
           Replace branch instructions not determinable to be in range and all call instructions with &quot;jmp&quot; and &quot;callr&quot; sequences (respectively).  This option generates absolute relocations against the target symbols and is not appropriate for position-independent code.

       -no-relax
           Do not replace any branches or calls.

       -EB Generate big-endian output.

       -EL Generate little-endian output.  This is the default.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a TMS320C6000 processor.

       -march=arch
           Enable (only) instructions from architecture arch.  By default, all instructions are permitted.

           The following values of arch are accepted: &quot;c62x&quot;, &quot;c64x&quot;, &quot;c64x+&quot;, &quot;c67x&quot;, &quot;c67x+&quot;, &quot;c674x&quot;.

       -mdsbt
       -mno-dsbt
           The -mdsbt option causes the assembler to generate the &quot;Tag_ABI_DSBT&quot; attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the code is using DSBT addressing.  The -mno-dsbt option, the default, causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating that the code does not use DSBT addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if objects of different type (DSBT and non-DSBT) are linked together.

       -mpid=no
       -mpid=near
       -mpid=far
           The -mpid= option causes the assembler to generate the &quot;Tag_ABI_PID&quot; attribute with a value indicating the form of data addressing used by the code.  -mpid=no, the default, indicates position-dependent data addressing, -mpid=near indicates position-independent addressing with GOT accesses using near DP addressing, and -mpid=far indicates position-independent addressing with GOT accesses using far DP addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if objects built with different settings of this option are linked together.

       -mpic
       -mno-pic
           The -mpic option causes the assembler to generate the &quot;Tag_ABI_PIC&quot; attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the code is using position-independent code addressing,  The &quot;-mno-pic&quot; option, the default, causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating position-dependent code addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if objects of different type (position-dependent and position-independent) are linked together.

       -mbig-endian
       -mlittle-endian
           Generate code for the specified endianness.  The default is little-endian.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a TILE-Gx processor.

       -m32 | -m64
           Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.

       -EB | -EL
           Select the endianness, either big-endian (-EB) or little-endian (-EL).

       The following options are available when as is configured for an Xtensa processor.

       --text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literals
           Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is --no-text-section-literals, which places literals in separate sections in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With --text-section-literals, the literals are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly files, where the literals would otherwise be out of range of the &quot;L32R&quot; instructions in the text section.  These options only affect literals referenced via PC-relative &quot;L32R&quot; instructions; literals for absolute mode &quot;L32R&quot; instructions are handled separately.

       --absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literals
           Indicate to the assembler whether &quot;L32R&quot; instructions use absolute or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor includes the absolute addressing option, the default is to use absolute &quot;L32R&quot; relocations.  Otherwise, only the PC-relative &quot;L32R&quot; relocations can be used.

       --target-align | --no-target-align
           Enable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch penalties at some expense in code size.    This optimization is enabled by default.  Note that the assembler will always align instructions like &quot;LOOP&quot; that have fixed alignment requirements.

       --longcalls | --no-longcalls
           Enable or disable transformation of call instructions to allow calls across a greater range of addresses.    This option should be used when call targets can potentially be out of range.  It may degrade both code size and performance, but the linker can generally optimize away the unnecessary overhead when a call ends up within range.  The default is --no-longcalls.

       --transform | --no-transform
           Enable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa instructions, including both relaxation and optimization.  The default is --transform; --no-transform should only be used in the rare cases when the instructions must be exactly as specified in the assembly source.  Using --no-transform causes out of range instruction operands to be errors.

       --rename-section oldname=newname
           Rename the oldname section to newname.  This option can be used multiple times to rename multiple sections.

       The following options are available when as is configured for a Z80 family processor.

       -z80
           Assemble for Z80 processor.

       -r800
           Assemble for R800 processor.

       -ignore-undocumented-instructions
       -Wnud
           Assemble undocumented Z80 instructions that also work on R800 without warning.

       -ignore-unportable-instructions
       -Wnup
           Assemble all undocumented Z80 instructions without warning.

       -warn-undocumented-instructions
       -Wud
           Issue a warning for undocumented Z80 instructions that also work on R800.

       -warn-unportable-instructions
       -Wup
           Issue a warning for undocumented Z80 instructions that do not work on R800.

       -forbid-undocumented-instructions
       -Fud
           Treat all undocumented instructions as errors.

       -forbid-unportable-instructions
       -Fup
           Treat undocumented Z80 instructions that do not work on R800 as errors.
