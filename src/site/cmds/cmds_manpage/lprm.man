NAME
       lprm - cancel print jobs

SYNOPSIS
       lprm [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -P destination[/instance] ] [ - ] [ job ID(s) ]

DESCRIPTION
       lprm cancels print jobs that have been queued for printing.  If no arguments are supplied, the current job on the default destination is cancelled. You can specify one or more job ID numbers to cancel those jobs or use the - option to cancel all jobs.

OPTIONS
       The lprm command supports the following options:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -P destination[/instance]
            Specifies the destination printer or class.

       -U username
            Specifies an alternate username.

       -h server[:port]
            Specifies an alternate server.

COMPATIBILITY
       The CUPS version of lprm is compatible with the standard Berkeley lprm command.
