# setuid/setgid makes a program start with the permissions of the user that owns
# the file, regardless of the user running the program. This can be abused to 
# take over a machine, so use this with care. Note that on most systems, you
# cannot set this on interpreted programs (shell scripts, for example)
#
# Marking a program setuid is done with the 'chmod' command, using either the first
# digit of a 4 bit permission set, or using the 'u' flag when using letters.
#
# To set a program as setuid and setgid with letters:
chmod ug+s /usr/bin/mybinary

# To set a program as setuid and setgid with regular mode digits:
chmod 6744 /usr/bin/mybinary
