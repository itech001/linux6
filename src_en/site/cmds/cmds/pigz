# pigz parallel gzip implementation example - gzip one file with 4 cpu cores
pigz -p 4 filename.txt

#to gzip entire folder must pass to gzip with tar (and set variable for cores)
#gzip /dirtogzip into /directory/gzipfile.tar.gz using 4 cores
export PIGZ="-p4"
tar cf /directory/gzipfile.tar.gz --use-compress-program=pigz /dirtogzip

# uncompress file with pigz (although standard gnu gzip can be used also -pigz 
# decompression may be slightly faster but not to the extent of the compression)
gzip -d filename.gz
