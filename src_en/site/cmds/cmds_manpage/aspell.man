NAME
       aspell - interactive spell checker

SYNOPSIS
       aspell [options] <command>

DESCRIPTION
       aspell is a utility program that connects to the Aspell library so that it can function as an ispell -a replacement, as an independent spell checker, as a test utility to test out Aspell library features, and as a utility for managing dictionaries used by the library.

       The Aspell library contains an interface allowing other programs direct access to its functions and therefore reducing the complex task of spell checking to simple library calls.  The default library does not contain dictionary word lists.  To add language dictionaries, please check your distro first for modified dictionaries, otherwise look here for base language dictionaries <http://aspell.net>.

       The following information describes the commands and options used by the Aspell Utility.

       This manual page is maintained separately from the official documentation so it may be out of date or incomplete.  The official documentation is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  See the `aspell' entry in info for more complete documentation.

DICTIONARY OPTIONS
       The following options may be used to control which dictionaries to use and how they behave.

       --master=<name>, -d <name>
              Base name of the dictionary to use.  If this option is specified then Aspell will either use this dictionary or die.

       --dict-dir=<directory>
              Location of the main dictionary word list.

       --lang=<string>, -l <string>
              Language to use.  It follows the same format of the LANG environmental variable on most systems. It consists of the two letter ISO 639 language code and an optional two letter ISO 3166 country code after a dash or underscore. The default value is based on the value of the LC_MESSAGES locale.

       --size=<string>
              The preferred size of the dictionary word list.  This consists of a two char digit code describing the size of the list, with typical values of: 10=tiny, 20=really small, 30=small, 40=med-small, 50=med, 60=med-large, 70=large, 80=huge, 90=insane.

       --variety=<string>
              Any extra information to distinguish this variety of dictionary from other dictionaries which may have the same lang and size.

       --jargon=<string>
              Please use the variety option since it replaces jargon as a better choice.  jargon will be removed in the future.

       --word-list-path=<list of directories>
              Search path for word list information files.

       --personal=<file>, -p <file>

              Save the replacement word list on save all.

       --encoding=<string>
              encoding the document is expected to be in.  The default depends on the current locale.

       --add-email-quote=<list>, --rem-email-quote=<list>

       --email-margin=<integer>

              Consider run-together words valid.

       --run-together-limit=<integer>

       --run-together-min=<integer>
              Minimal length of interior words.

MISC OPTIONS
       Miscellaneous options that don't fall under any other category.

       --conf=<file name>
              Main configuration file.  This file overrides Aspell's global defaults.

       --conf-dir=<directory>
              Location of main configuration file.

       --data-dir=<directory>
              Location of language data files.

       --keyboard=<keyboard>
              Use this keyboard layout for suggesting possible words.  These spelling errors happen if a user accidently presses a key next to the intended correct key.

       --local-data-dir=<directory>
              Alternative location of language data files.  This directory is searched before data-dir.

       --home-dir=<directory>
              Directory Location for personal wordlist files.

       --per-conf=<file name>
              Personal configuration file.  This file overrides options found in the global config file.

ASPELL UTILITY OPTIONS
       These options are part of the aspell Utility and work independently of the library.

       --backup, --dont-backup, -b, -x
              The aspell utility creates a backup file by making a copy and appending .bak to file name.  This only applies when the command is check <file> and the backup file is only created if any spelling modifications take place.

       --byte-offsets, --dont-byte-offsets
              Use byte offsets instead of character offsets.

       --guess, --dont-guess, -m, -P
              Create missing root/affix combinations not in the dictionary in pipe mode.

       --keymapping=aspell, --keymapping=ispell
              The keymapping to use, either aspell for the default mapping or ispell to use the same mapping that the Ispell utility uses.

       --reverse, --dont-reverse
              Reverse the order of the suggestions list in pipe mode.

       --suggest, --dont-suggest
              Suggest possible replacements in pipe mode. If false, Aspell will simply report the misspelling and make no attempt at suggestions or possible corrections.

       --time, --dont-time
              Time the load time and suggest a time in pipe mode.

       In addition Aspell will try to make sense out of Ispell's command line options so that it can function as a drop in replacement for Ispell.  If Aspell is run without any command line options it will display a brief help screen and quit.

CONFIGURATION
       Aspell can accept options via global or personal configuration files so that you do not need to specify them each time at the command line.  The default global configuration file is /etc/aspell.conf or another file specified by option --conf and is checked first.  The default per user configuration file ~/.aspell.conf located in the $HOME directory (or another file specified by option --per-conf) is checked next and overrides options set in the global config file.  Options specified at either the command line or via an environmental variable override those specified by either configuration file.

       Each line of the configuration file has the format:

              option [value]

       where option is any one of the standard library options above without the leading dashes.  For example the following line will set the default language to Swiss German:

              lang de_CH

       There may be any number of spaces between the option and the value, however it can only be spaces, i.e. there is no '=' between the option name and the value.  Comments may also be included by preceding them with a '#' as anything from a '#' to a newline is ignored.  Blank lines are also allowed.  The /etc/aspell.conf file is a good example of how to set these options and the Aspell Manual has more detailed info.

SUPPORT
       Support for Aspell can be found on the Aspell mailing lists.  Instructions for joining the various mailing lists (and an archive of them) can be found off the Aspell home page at <http://aspell.net>.  Bug reports should be submitted via the Sourceforge Tracker rather than being posted to the mailing lists.
