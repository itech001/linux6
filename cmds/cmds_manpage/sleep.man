NAME
       sleep - delay for a specified amount of time

SYNOPSIS
       sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX]...
       sleep OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Pause for NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be 's' for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.  Unlike most implementations that require NUMBER be an integer, here NUMBER may be an arbitrary floating point number.  Given two or more arguments, pause for the amount of time specified by the sum of their values.
