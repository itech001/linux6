<h3 id="description">description</h3>
<pre><code>       Iptables and ip6tables are used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 and IPv6
       packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.  Several different tables may be defined.  Each ta‐
       ble contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.

       Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.  Each rule specifies what to
       do with a packet that matches.  This is called a `target', which may be a jump  to  a  user-
       defined chain in the same table.

</code></pre>

<h3 id="targets">targets</h3>
<pre><code>       A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet and a target.  If the packet does not match,
       the next rule in the chain is examined; if it does match, then the next rule is specified by
       the  value  of the target, which can be the name of a user-defined chain, one of the targets
       described in iptables-extensions(8), or one of the special values ACCEPT, DROP or RETURN.

       ACCEPT means to let the packet through.  DROP means to drop the packet on the floor.  RETURN
       means  stop  traversing  this  chain  and  resume at the next rule in the previous (calling)
       chain.  If the end of a built-in chain is reached or a rule in a built-in chain with  target
       RETURN  is  matched,  the  target  specified  by the chain policy determines the fate of the
       packet.

</code></pre>

<h3 id="tables">tables</h3>
<pre><code>       There are currently five independent tables (which tables are present at any time depends on
       the kernel configuration options and which modules are present).

       -t, --table table
              This  option specifies the packet matching table which the command should operate on.
              If the kernel is configured with automatic module loading, an attempt will be made to
              load the appropriate module for that table if it is not already there.

              The tables are as follows:

              filter:
                  This  is  the default table (if no -t option is passed). It contains the built-in
                  chains INPUT (for packets destined to local sockets), FORWARD (for packets  being
                  routed through the box), and OUTPUT (for locally-generated packets).

              nat:
                  This  table  is  consulted when a packet that creates a new connection is encoun‐
                  tered.  It consists of three built-ins: PREROUTING (for altering packets as  soon
                  as they come in), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing),
                  and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to  go  out).   IPv6  NAT
                  support is available since kernel 3.7.

              mangle:
                  This table is used for specialized packet alteration.  Until kernel 2.4.17 it had
                  two built-in chains: PREROUTING (for altering incoming  packets  before  routing)
                  and OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing).  Since kernel
                  2.4.18, three other built-in chains are also supported: INPUT (for packets coming
                  into  the  box  itself),  FORWARD  (for altering packets being routed through the
                  box), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out).

              raw:
                  This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from connection tracking  in
                  combination  with  the  NOTRACK target.  It registers at the netfilter hooks with
                  higher priority and is thus called before ip_conntrack, or any other  IP  tables.
                  It  provides  the following built-in chains: PREROUTING (for packets arriving via
                  any network interface) OUTPUT (for packets generated by local processes)

              security:
                  This table is used for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) networking rules,  such  as
                  those  enabled  by the SECMARK and CONNSECMARK targets.  Mandatory Access Control
                  is implemented by Linux Security Modules such as SELinux.  The security table  is
                  called  after  the  filter table, allowing any Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
                  rules in the filter table to take effect before MAC rules.  This  table  provides
                  the  following  built-in  chains: INPUT (for packets coming into the box itself),
                  OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing), and FORWARD  (for
                  altering packets being routed through the box).

</code></pre>

<h3 id="options">options</h3>
<pre><code>       The  options  that are recognized by iptables and ip6tables can be divided into several dif‐
       ferent groups.

   COMMANDS
       These options specify the desired action to perform. Only one of them can  be  specified  on
       the  command line unless otherwise stated below. For long versions of the command and option
       names, you need to use only enough letters to ensure that iptables can differentiate it from
       all other options.

       -A, --append chain rule-specification
              Append  one  or  more rules to the end of the selected chain.  When the source and/or
              destination names resolve to more than one address, a rule will  be  added  for  each
              possible address combination.

       -C, --check chain rule-specification
              Check  whether  a  rule  matching the specification does exist in the selected chain.
              This command uses the same logic as -D to find a matching entry, but does  not  alter
              the  existing  iptables  configuration  and uses its exit code to indicate success or
              failure.

       -D, --delete chain rule-specification
       -D, --delete chain rulenum
              Delete one or more rules from the selected chain.  There are  two  versions  of  this
              command:  the  rule  can be specified as a number in the chain (starting at 1 for the
              first rule) or a rule to match.

       -I, --insert chain [rulenum] rule-specification
              Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule number.  So, if  the
              rule  number  is 1, the rule or rules are inserted at the head of the chain.  This is
              also the default if no rule number is specified.

       -R, --replace chain rulenum rule-specification
              Replace a rule in the selected chain.  If the source and/or destination names resolve
              to multiple addresses, the command will fail.  Rules are numbered starting at 1.

       -L, --list [chain]
              List  all  rules  in  the  selected  chain.   If no chain is selected, all chains are
              listed. Like every other iptables command, it applies to the specified table  (filter
              is the default), so NAT rules get listed by
               iptables -t nat -n -L
              Please  note that it is often used with the -n option, in order to avoid long reverse
              DNS lookups.  It is legal to specify the -Z (zero) option as well, in which case  the
              chain(s)  will  be atomically listed and zeroed.  The exact output is affected by the
              other arguments given. The exact rules are suppressed until you use
               iptables -L -v

       -S, --list-rules [chain]
              Print all rules in the selected chain.  If no  chain  is  selected,  all  chains  are
              printed  like  iptables-save.  Like  every  other iptables command, it applies to the
              specified table (filter is the default).

       -F, --flush [chain]
              Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none  is  given).   This  is
              equivalent to deleting all the rules one by one.

       -Z, --zero [chain [rulenum]]
              Zero the packet and byte counters in all chains, or only the given chain, or only the
              given rule in a chain. It is legal to specify the -L, --list (list) option  as  well,
              to see the counters immediately before they are cleared. (See above.)

       -N, --new-chain chain
              Create  a  new user-defined chain by the given name.  There must be no target of that
              name already.

       -X, --delete-chain [chain]
              Delete the optional user-defined chain specified.  There must be no references to the
              chain.  If there are, you must delete or replace the referring rules before the chain
              can be deleted.  The chain must be empty, i.e. not contain any rules.  If no argument
              is given, it will attempt to delete every non-builtin chain in the table.

       -P, --policy chain target
              Set  the  policy  for the chain to the given target.  See the section TARGETS for the
              legal targets.  Only built-in (non-user-defined) chains can have policies,  and  nei‐
              ther built-in nor user-defined chains can be policy targets.

       -E, --rename-chain old-chain new-chain
              Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name.  This is cosmetic, and has
              no effect on the structure of the table.

       -h     Help.  Give a (currently very brief) description of the command syntax.

   PARAMETERS
       The following parameters make up a rule specification (as used in the add,  delete,  insert,
       replace and append commands).

       -4, --ipv4
              This  option  has no effect in iptables and iptables-restore.  If a rule using the -4
              option is inserted with (and  only  with)  ip6tables-restore,  it  will  be  silently
              ignored.  Any  other uses will throw an error. This option allows IPv4 and IPv6 rules
              in a single rule file for use with both iptables-restore and ip6tables-restore.

       -6, --ipv6
              If a rule using the -6 option is inserted with (and only with)  iptables-restore,  it
              will be silently ignored. Any other uses will throw an error. This option allows IPv4
              and IPv6 rules in  a  single  rule  file  for  use  with  both  iptables-restore  and
              ip6tables-restore.  This option has no effect in ip6tables and ip6tables-restore.

       [!] -p, --protocol protocol
              The  protocol  of  the rule or of the packet to check.  The specified protocol can be
              one of tcp, udp, udplite, icmp, icmpv6,esp, ah,  sctp,  mh  or  the  special  keyword
              &quot;all&quot;, or it can be a numeric value, representing one of these protocols or a differ‐
              ent one.  A protocol name from /etc/protocols is also allowed.  A &quot;!&quot; argument before
              the  protocol  inverts  the  test.   The number zero is equivalent to all. &quot;all&quot; will
              match with all protocols and is taken as default when this option is  omitted.   Note
              that,  in  ip6tables,  IPv6  extension  headers  except esp are not allowed.  esp and
              ipv6-nonext can be used with Kernel version 2.6.11 or  later.   The  number  zero  is
              equivalent  to all, which means that you cannot test the protocol field for the value
              0 directly. To match on a HBH header, even if it were the last, you cannot use -p  0,
              but always need -m hbh.

       [!] -s, --source address[/mask][,...]
              Source  specification. Address can be either a network name, a hostname, a network IP
              address (with /mask), or a plain IP address. Hostnames will be  resolved  once  only,
              before  the rule is submitted to the kernel.  Please note that specifying any name to
              be resolved with a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea.  The  mask  can  be
              either  an  ipv4 network mask (for iptables) or a plain number, specifying the number
              of 1's at the left side of the network mask.  Thus, an iptables mask of 24 is equiva‐
              lent  to  255.255.255.0.  A &quot;!&quot; argument before the address specification inverts the
              sense of the address. The flag --src is an alias for this option.  Multiple addresses
              can  be  specified,  but this will expand to multiple rules (when adding with -A), or
              will cause multiple rules to be deleted (with -D).

       [!] -d, --destination address[/mask][,...]
              Destination specification.  See the  description  of  the  -s  (source)  flag  for  a
              detailed description of the syntax.  The flag --dst is an alias for this option.

       -m, --match match
              Specifies  a  match  to  use,  that is, an extension module that tests for a specific
              property. The set of matches make up the condition under which a target  is  invoked.
              Matches  are  evaluated  first  to  last as specified on the command line and work in
              short-circuit fashion, i.e. if one extension yields false, evaluation will stop.

       -j, --jump target
              This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if  the  packet  matches  it.
              The  target  can be a user-defined chain (other than the one this rule is in), one of
              the special builtin targets which decide the fate of the packet  immediately,  or  an
              extension (see EXTENSIONS below).  If this option is omitted in a rule (and -g is not
              used), then matching the rule will have no effect on the packet's fate, but the coun‐
              ters on the rule will be incremented.

       -g, --goto chain
              This  specifies that the processing should continue in a user specified chain. Unlike
              the --jump option return will not continue processing in this chain  but  instead  in
              the chain that called us via --jump.

       [!] -i, --in-interface name
              Name  of  an interface via which a packet was received (only for packets entering the
              INPUT, FORWARD and PREROUTING chains).  When the &quot;!&quot;  argument  is  used  before  the
              interface name, the sense is inverted.  If the interface name ends in a &quot;+&quot;, then any
              interface which begins with this name will match.  If this  option  is  omitted,  any
              interface name will match.

       [!] -o, --out-interface name
              Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets entering the
              FORWARD, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING chains).  When the &quot;!&quot; argument is  used  before  the
              interface name, the sense is inverted.  If the interface name ends in a &quot;+&quot;, then any
              interface which begins with this name will match.  If this  option  is  omitted,  any
              interface name will match.

       [!] -f, --fragment
              This  means  that  the rule only refers to second and further IPv4 fragments of frag‐
              mented packets.  Since there is no way to tell the source  or  destination  ports  of
              such  a  packet  (or ICMP type), such a packet will not match any rules which specify
              them.  When the &quot;!&quot; argument precedes the &quot;-f&quot; flag, the rule will  only  match  head
              fragments, or unfragmented packets. This option is IPv4 specific, it is not available
              in ip6tables.

       -c, --set-counters packets bytes
              This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte counters of  a  rule
              (during INSERT, APPEND, REPLACE operations).

   OTHER OPTIONS
       The following additional options can be specified:

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose output.  This option makes the list command show the interface name, the rule
              options (if any), and the TOS masks.  The packet and byte counters are  also  listed,
              with  the  suffix  'K',  'M' or 'G' for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 multipliers
              respectively (but see the -x flag to change this).  For appending,  insertion,  dele‐
              tion  and  replacement,  this  causes detailed information on the rule or rules to be
              printed. -v may be specified multiple times to  possibly  emit  more  detailed  debug
              statements.

       -w, --wait
              Wait for the xtables lock.  To prevent multiple instances of the program from running
              concurrently, an attempt will be made to obtain an  exclusive  lock  at  launch.   By
              default, the program will exit if the lock cannot be obtained.  This option will make
              the program wait until the exclusive lock can be obtained.

       -n, --numeric
              Numeric output.  IP addresses and port numbers will be printed in numeric format.  By
              default,  the  program will try to display them as host names, network names, or ser‐
              vices (whenever applicable).

       -x, --exact
              Expand numbers.  Display the exact value of the packet and byte counters, instead  of
              only  the  rounded  number in K's (multiples of 1000) M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's
              (multiples of 1000M).  This option is only relevant for the -L command.

       --line-numbers
              When listing rules, add line numbers to the beginning of each rule, corresponding  to
              that rule's position in the chain.

       --modprobe=command
              When  adding  or inserting rules into a chain, use command to load any necessary mod‐
              ules (targets, match extensions, etc).

<h3 id="match-and-target-extensions">match and target extensions</h3>
<pre><code>       iptables can use extended packet matching and target modules.  A list of these is  available
       in the iptables-extensions(8) manpage.

<h3 id="diagnostics">diagnostics</h3>
<pre><code>       Various  error messages are printed to standard error.  The exit code is 0 for correct func‐
       tioning.  Errors which appear to be caused by invalid  or  abused  command  line  parameters
       cause an exit code of 2, and other errors cause an exit code of 1.

<h3 id="compatibility-with-ipchains">compatibility with ipchains</h3>
<pre><code>       This iptables is very similar to ipchains by Rusty Russell.  The main difference is that the
       chains INPUT and OUTPUT are only traversed for packets coming into the local host and origi‐
       nating from the local host respectively.  Hence every packet only passes through one of  the
       three  chains (except loopback traffic, which involves both INPUT and OUTPUT chains); previ‐
       ously a forwarded packet would pass through all three.

       The other main difference is that -i refers to the input interface; -o refers to the  output
       interface, and both are available for packets entering the FORWARD chain.

       The  various  forms  of  NAT  have been separated out; iptables is a pure packet filter when
       using the default `filter' table, with optional extension  modules.   This  should  simplify
       much  of the previous confusion over the combination of IP masquerading and packet filtering
       seen previously.  So the following options are handled differently:
        -j MASQ
        -M -S
        -M -L
       There are several other changes in iptables.

<h3 id="authors">authors</h3>
<pre><code>       Rusty Russell originally wrote iptables, in early consultation with Michael Neuling.

       Marc Boucher made Rusty abandon ipnatctl by lobbying for a generic packet  selection  frame‐
       work  in  iptables,  then  wrote  the mangle table, the owner match, the mark stuff, and ran
       around doing cool stuff everywhere.

       James Morris wrote the TOS target, and tos match.

       Jozsef Kadlecsik wrote the REJECT target.

       Harald Welte wrote the ULOG and NFQUEUE target, the new libiptc, as well as the  TTL,  DSCP,
       ECN matches and targets.

       The Netfilter Core Team is: Marc Boucher, Martin Josefsson, Yasuyuki Kozakai, Jozsef Kadlec‐
       sik, Patrick McHardy, James Morris, Pablo Neira Ayuso, Harald Welte and Rusty Russell.
